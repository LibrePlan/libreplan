  Basic documentation about LibrePlan web services usage.


.. contents:: Table of Contents


Introduction
------------

Inside ``scripts/rest-clients/`` folder of LibrePlan source code, you can find
several scripts to test LibrePlan web services. There are web services for
most import entities in the application. And if needed more could be easily
developed.

All *integration entities* (LibrePlan entities that can be exported and/or
imported) has a common attribute called ``code``. This field would be the one
used to share information between LibrePlan and other systems or other LibrePlan
instances.

LibrePlan web services are REST based. But, they are just using two HTTP
methods with the following meaning:

* ``GET``: Used to extract information from LibrePlan. For each case they will
  return a list with all the entities. For example, resources web service will
  return a list with all application resources.

  You can also pass ``code`` attribute (since LibrePlan 1.2) in order to return
  just one entity sending the code as a GET parameter.

* ``POST``: Used to add and update information in LibrePlan. These services will
  receive a XML file with a list of entities. For each entity there could be 2
  different cases:

  * If it already exists: Update entity with new data.
  * If it does not exist: Add the new entity.

These means that delete is not allowed from web services, in that way only new
info could be added or updated. This is because of entities are related with
others and remove operation could be dangerous. Then if necessary, the
recommendation would be add a field to disable such entity.


Requirements
------------

These scripts are written in bash so you need to be running a bash terminal to
use them.

Moreover, it is recommended to have Tidy available in your system. You can
install it with the following command in Debian based distributions::

  # apt-get install tidy

In openSUSE with::

  # zypper install tidy

Or in Fedora with::

  # yum install tidy


Default credentials
-------------------

In order to test these scripts you will need an user with reader and writer
permissions for web services of LibrePlan. Default credentials are:

* Reader permission:

  * User: ``wsreader``
  * Password: ``wsreader``

* Writer permission:

  * User: ``wswriter``
  * Password: ``wswriter``

.. NOTE::

  LibrePlan web services use `HTTP Basic Authentication`_

.. _`HTTP Basic Authentication`: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html#BasicAA


Common parameters
-----------------

There are already defined several parameters to be used in the scripts to define
the server to execute the tests:

Demo environment (``without parameters``) - default

  Use server where demo is launched using the following URL:
  ``http://demo.libreplan.org/libreplan/``

  Example::

    $ ./export-resources.sh

Production environment (``--prod``)

  Use server deployed with Tomcat in a production deployment in the following
  URL: ``http://localhost:8080/libreplan/`` (the installation done by Debian
  package).

  Example::

    $ ./export-resources.sh --prod

Development environment (``--dev``)

  Use server deployed with Jetty during development in the following URL:
  ``http://localhost:8080/libreplan-webapp/``

  Example::

    $ ./export-resources.sh --dev


XML Schemas
-----------

To get XML schema use the following script::

  $ get-xml-schema.sh <service-path>

Example::

  $ get-xml-schema.sh resources

You can also get it with a browser going to the following URL using a user with
read credentials for web services: ``/ws/rest/<service-path>/?_wadl&_type=xml``


Export scripts
--------------

There are several scripts to just get information from LibrePlan system. They
alway start with ``export-`` prefix. These scripts usually don't need any
parameter (apart from the one to select the environment). They will return a XML
output with the data requested.

Example::

  $ ./export-resources.sh

To export just one specific resource by code you can add a new extra parameter.
Example::

  $ ./export-resources.sh WORKER00011


Import scripts
--------------

As for the previous point, in order to insert data in LibrePlan system thought
web services there are several scripts with prefix ``import-``. In this case,
these scripts need a special parameter, that would be a XML file with data to be
inserted in LibrePlan. There are usually files with ``-sample`` suffix as
example data. Again, output for these scripts is a XML message with the possible
errors trying to insert the data in the system.

Example::

  $ ./import-resources.sh resources-sample.xml
