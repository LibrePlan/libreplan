Version 1.2.0 (01 Dec 2011)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

In the current 1.2.0 version the project has been renamed to LibrePlan and this
will be the official name for the project from now on. With the new name,
decided by the community, we are remarking that LibrePlan is a generic purpose
planning tool, suitable to many sectors.

Besides, with this new version, the project has a new image and a revamped
website that you can visit at http://www.libreplan.com/

This new major version comes with important new features apart from all the
bugfixing done since the 1.1 major release. Among the new features, these are
the most relevant ones:

* Migration to ZK 5 Community Edition.

  LibrePlan uses ZK framework as UI toolkit and in this release has been
  migrated the interface from ZK 3.6 to ZK 5.0.

  ZK 5 was incompatible with version version 3.6 and this movement have implied:

  * Reimplementing LibrePlan custom UI widgets in ZK 5.0 architecture

  * Providing an implementation in ZK 5.0 for widgets in 3.6 version which
    changed their license and which are not open source anymore.

  * Reviewing all the application windows and to do small configuration and
    formatting changes.

  This allows us to get advantage of the latest innovations in rich web
  interfaces and enjoy both the performance and architectural enhancements of
  this new ZK version.

* Resource allocation engine enhancements.

  The planner engine has been improved with three new functionalities regarding
  to allocation engine:

  * Task movements in Gantt view keeps the configured allocation function.
    Before this, if you configured a stretches function or sigmoid function in
    a resource allocation and the task was moved because a dependency or
    constraint set by the user, the allocation function applied in the new
    point was the flat function. Now, the configured stretches or sigmoid
    function is used.

  * Manual allocation automatic detection in advanced allocation. Now if the
    user changes the allocation of a task in advanced allocation window, the
    type of allocation is automatically tracked as manual.

  * Manual allocation locking support in Gantt view. So far if a task had a
    manual allocation and was moved in the Gantt, the custom allocation was
    lost and a flat function was applied. In this version, a keep manual
    allocation strategy has been implemented. It consists of disabling the
    automatic movement of those allocated tasks in the Gantt by being
    configured with a START IN FIXED DATE constraint after the manual
    allocation. If the user wants to move these tasks, he has to change in
    first place the allocation function used and, in second place, has to
    remove the constraint. In this way, the manual allocation configured is not
    lost by accident.

* Sharing state between perspectives.

  The project planning in LibrePlan is achieved by using several perspectives:

  * Project scheduling (Gantt).
  * Project details (WBS).
  * Resource load
  * Advanced allocation.

  Until this version, the user had to save before abandoning a perspective to
  avoid losing the changes on going to another. To improve this, in this
  release, the planning data has been shared among all the project perspectives
  and on saving in one of them, all the planning data is stored.

  This a more natural way of creating the project plan. Now the user can move
  freely among the project views configuring different things and, on reaching
  a desired state, he can ask to persist changes.

  Besides, with this new feature, the loss of changes by accident is prevented
  on a perspective change without saving first.

* LDAP authentication and authorization module.

  In this version the possibility of using LDAP as backend for users has been
  implemented.

  An LDAP authentication and authorization module has been developed. With
  this, it is possible to use the users configured in the company directory
  without the need to create them in LibrePlan manually.

  The main features of this module are:

  * User passwords saving in LibrePlan database after right authentication
    option. This allows the LDAP users enter the application if the LDAP is
    off-line.

  * Role matching support. It is possible to map LDAP roles to LibrePlan
    permissions. Two strategies are provided: Group strategy (all the users
    under a node) and property strategy (property of the node user with all the
    role values).

* My account area.

  It has been developed a new top level menu entry called *My account* with
  several options with a per user scope. This means that they are operations
  that concern only to the connected user which is configuring them.

  The operations included in this zone are:

  * Personal data. User can manage his contact information

  * Application preferences. User can select the language of the application
    and if if the load charts of the planning windows appear folded or
    unfolded  by default.

  * Password administration. User can change his own password.

* Functional tests.

  One of the maxims of LibrePlan is to create a project with good quality. For
  this reason in this version functional tests to the project have been
  incorporated into the project.

  Functional tests are black-box tests in which the interface of the program is
  tested. The tool which has been chosen is Sahi and it allows verifying that
  all functionalities keep working successfully.

  An initial set of Sahi tests have been developed and they will be increased
  as time passes.

* Other minor tasks implemented:

  * Internationalization. Some strings were not being translated accordingly to
    the language used under certain conditions.

  * Default login auto-completion is now configurable, you can disable it from
    the configuration window.

  * Now when editing contents, information identifiying the element being
    edited is always displayed on the page heading.

  * Work reports minute detail level support has been added. This allows users
    to specify how many hours and minutes they have devoted to each task.
    Reports have been updated accordingly to include the work time in minutes
    too.

  * LibrePlan web services have now a new method to export only one entity by
    specifying its code.

  * Russian and Portuguese translations. Apart from English, Spanish and
    Galician now LibrePlan is also available in Russian and Portuguese.

Version 1.1.0 (19 May 2011)
---------------------------

New major version of NavalPlan. Apart from a lot of bugfixing the main features
included in this version are:

* Fixed problem with WebKit based browsers.

  Now WebKit based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Epiphany) and last version of
  Firefox are fully supported.

* Fixed issues in printing.

  Printing uses a WebKit based solution and thus failed occasionally because of
  the previous issue that is fixed now.

* Over allocation control support.

  In 1.0 version it was not possible to configure a limit of overtime for
  workers. From now on users can configure calendars with this feature. You can
  set a maximum overtime in each regular work week day or in a specific
  exception day.

  This provides a lot of flexibility in the resource allocation strategies. You
  can do allocations without generating overtime or generating a controlled
  amount of it. In this way, users can ask the application to calculate the
  soonest finish date for a task taking into account the overtime allowed.

  A last clarification about this control is that is done per task. The maximum
  allocation assigned to a worker is observed per task. This means that if you
  have two tasks in the same period assigned to the same resource, taking into
  both tasks, you can surpass the overtime constraint.

* Hierarchical criteria enforced.

  Criteria in NavalPlan are like dynamic roles that resources can satisfy and
  can be hierarchical. This means that one general criterion can include other
  more specific criteria inside. For instance, it is possible to configure the
  general criterion Engineer with two children like Electric Engineer and
  Software Engineer.

  This feature was disabled in version 1.0.4 and is provided again after some
  fixes were done.

* New generic allocation algorithm.

  Generic allocation is the assignment based on criteria. You specify the set
  of criteria which must be satisfied by the workers who are able to do the
  task and, after this, NavalPlan looks for them and selects the ones less
  loaded to be planned.

  The algorithm which selects the workers to be assigned to a task when
  generic allocation is used was improved in several points:

  * The sharing hours process allocates workers when selected up to load 100%.
  * On selecting workers for a date inside a task, the new algorithm tries to
    use the workers assigned in the previous days of the task. In this way, the
    algorithm is not based just in load but selects first the previously used
    resources if they have free hours.

* Project scheduling window new features.

  In the project scheduling window four improvements were done:

  * Positioning system on zoom changes. Now when the user changes the zoom
    level in the Gantt planning window, after the screen has been refreshed
    the scroll is moved so the user will see the same time period.
  * Calendar exception days are shown in the Gantt planning grid with a
    different background color. At day and week zoom level the project
    calendar is used to highlight the non-working days.
  * Violated dependencies are highlighted. A red color is used to draw
    dependencies that are violated.
  * Resource load chart precision was improved. Now two points per time unit
    are represented and this makes the chart more accurate in the resource load
    chart which is displayed in the bottom of Project Planning view, Project
    scheduling window, company resource usage screen and project resource usage
    screen.

* Default password change notification protocol.

  It was implemented a mechanism to control if the password for the default
  users have been changed. Default accounts which are provided are:

  * admin/admin. This user is the user with administration privileges.
  * user/user. This is a common user without administration privileges.
  * wswriter/wswriter. This user has write permissions to use then web
    services operations which require modify or insert data in NavalPlan.
  * wsreader/wsreader. This user has read permissions to the use web services
    operations which only require read permissions.

  The mechanism consists of showing warning messages in the left bottom corner
  of the screen remembering which default user accounts have still configured
  the default password.

* Minute accuracy in calendars and allocation windows.

  In 1.0 version calendars are expressed in hours the same as the amount of
  allocated time in tasks. This means that users cannot use minutes if they
  want to have a higher detail level in the plans.

  This was changed and now is possible to specify the calendars and the
  allocations in hours and minutes. In the allocation screens this is done
  with the ":" separator in the input boxes.

  A thing which is pending to be implemented is to allow estimate the WBS for
  a project in hours and minutes. In 1.1 is only allowed in hours.

* Limiting resources new insertion algorithm.

  It was implemented a new algorithm for inserting tasks in points where there
  are already tasks planned in the limiting resources. The new algorithm moves
  the tasks respecting better the order of the tasks already planned.

* Calendar interface revamp

  User interface for calendars was improved to provide an easier use.

* WBS screen

  This window was tested deeply and errors related to moving nodes in the tree
  were corrected.

Notes
