Administration of Materials
===========================

Users can manage a basic database of materials, organized by categories.

Categories are containers to which specific materials and other categories can be assigned. They are stored in a hierarchical tree structure, as materials can belong to leaf categories or intermediary categories.

To manage categories, users must follow these steps:

*   Go to the "Administration -> Materials" option.
*   The program displays a tree of categories.
*   Enter a category name in the text box and then click "Add."
*   The program adds the category to the tree.

To insert a category into the category tree, users must first select the parent category in the tree and then click "Add."
