Pipeline Dashboard
##################

.. contents::

The pipeline dashboard is a *LibrePlan* perspective that lists all company projects in a table. This "pipeline" table has nine columns, each corresponding to a project status:

   *   PRE-SALES
   *   OFFERED
   *   OUTSOURCED
   *   ACCEPTED
   *   STARTED
   *   ON HOLD
   *   FINISHED
   *   CANCELLED
   *   ARCHIVED

Projects are listed by name in each column based on their current status.

A project's start date, end date, and current progress can be viewed in a tooltip popup by hovering the mouse cursor over a project's name.

Projects with an *ARCHIVED* status can be hidden by unchecking the "Show archived column data" checkbox.
