Costs
=====

Cost management allows users to estimate the costs of resources used in a project. In order to manage costs, the following entities have to be determined:

* Hour type worked: These indicate the hour types worked for the resource. Users can include hour types for machines and for workers. Examples of hour types include: Additional hours paid at €20 per hour generically. The following fields can be included in the hour types worked:

   * Code: External code for the hour type.
   * Name: Name of the hour type. For example, additional.
   * Default rate: Basic default rate for the hour type.
   * Activation: Indicating whether the hour type is activated or not.

* Cost categories. Cost categories show categories that are used to define costs according to hour type during certain periods (these periods may be indefinite). For example, the cost of additional hours for first grade skilled workers in the following year is €24 per hour. Cost categories contain:

   * Name: Cost category name.
   * Activation: Indicating whether the category is activated or not.
   * List of hour types assigned to the cost category. They indicate several periods and rates for hour types. For example, as rates change, each year is included on this list as an hour type period, but an hourly rate is maintained for each hour type (which may be different from the default hourly rate included for the hour type).
