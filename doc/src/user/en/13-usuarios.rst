Managing users
==============

"NavalPlan"'s system enables users to manage profiles, authorisations and users. Users belong to user profiles, which may have a series of predefined roles to access the program. Roles are defined authorisations in "NavalPlan". Examples of roles:

* Administration: A role to which administrators must be assigned in order to be able to carry out administration operations.
* Web service reader: A role that users need to be able to consult the program's web services.
* Web service writer: A role that users need to be able to write via the program's web services.

Roles are predefined in the system. A user profile consists of one or several roles. Users must have certain roles to carry out certain operations.

Users have one or several profiles or one or several roles directly so that specific or generic authorisation can be assigned.

It is necessary to carry out the following steps to manage users:

* Go to "Manage users" on the "Administration" menu.
* The program shows a form with a list of users.
* Click the editing button for the chosen user or click the "Create" button.
* A form will appear with the following fields:

   * User name.
   * Password
