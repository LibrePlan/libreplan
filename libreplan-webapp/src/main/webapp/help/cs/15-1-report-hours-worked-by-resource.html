<li><strong>Filter by Workers:</strong>
*   <em>Type:</em> Optional.
*   <em>How it works:</em> You can select one or more workers to restrict the work reports to the time tracked by those specific workers.

<li><strong>Filter by Labels:</strong>
*   <em>Type:</em> Optional.
*   <em>How it works:</em> You can add one or more labels to use as filters by searching for them in the selector and clicking the <em>Add</em> button.

<li><strong>Filter by Criteria:</strong>
*   <em>Type:</em> Optional.
*   <em>How it works:</em> You can select one or more criteria by searching for them in the selector and then clicking the <em>Add</em> button.

<p>The report body consists of several groups of information.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The first level of aggregation is by resource. All the time dedicated by a resource is shown together below the header. Each resource is identified by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Worker:</em> Surname, First Name.</li>
<li><em>Machine:</em> Name.</li>
</ul>
<p>A summary line shows the total number of hours worked by the resource.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The second level of grouping is by <em>date</em>. All the reports from a specific resource on the same date are shown together.</p>
<p>A summary line shows the total number of hours worked by the resource on that date.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The final level lists the work reports for the worker on that day. The information displayed for each work report line is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Task Code:</em> The code of the task to which the tracked hours are attributed.</li>
<li><em>Task Name:</em> The name of the task to which the tracked hours are attributed.</li>
<li><em>Starting Time:</em> This is optional. It is the time at which the resource began working on the task.</li>
<li><em>Ending Time:</em> This is optional. It is the time at which the resource finished working on the task on the specified date.</li>
<li><em>Text Fields:</em> This is optional. If the work report line has text fields, the filled values are shown here. The format is: &lt;Name of the text field&gt;:&lt;Value&gt;</li>
<li><em>Labels:</em> This depends on whether the work report model has a label field in its definition. If there are multiple labels, they are shown in the same column. The format is: &lt;Name of the label type&gt;:&lt;Value of the label&gt;</li>
